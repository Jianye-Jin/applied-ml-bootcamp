# applied-ml-bootcamp
Goal: build a production-minded applied ML project scaffold for London ML Engineer interviews.
What’s inside: minimal src/ layout, data/ placeholder, and a runnable entrypoint.
Setup: create a virtual environment, then `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Run: `python3 -m src.train` (placeholder training entrypoint for now).
Data: keep raw datasets under `data/` locally (ignored by git).
Status: Day 1 scaffold (repo + structure + first runnable script).
